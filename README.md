# ZeroMQ with Raspberry Pi Demo

###What is ZeroMQ
http://zguide.zeromq.org
light weight message queue system
Think abstraction on top of TCP
intra-process and inter-process queues too
Many messaging patterns available
Publish-Subscribe is my favorite

###How can ZeroMQ be useful
Distribute computation between components
Asychronous computation
Integrate components using different languages, operating systems

###Why ZeroMQ is Cool?
Used in jupyter notebooks to communicate with kernels
No message broker needed
So many clients:
C++, C#, CL, Delphi, Erlang, F#, Felix, Haskell, Java, Objective-C, Ruby, Ada, Basic, Clojure, Go, Haxe, Node.js, ooc, Perl, Scala and more.

###Why is RaspberryPi cool?
Embedded computer thats cheap and powerful
Arm7 Quad Core Processor
1GB RAM
~$35
Think signal processing, image processing, data Analytics

###Sensor
Adafruit 10DOF sensor
https://www.adafruit.com/product/1604
L3GD20H Mems Gryo
I2C interface

###ThreeJS
A 3D javascript library
http://threejs.org/

###PyThreeJS
